This plugin encodes NON-ASCII characters in pretty permalinks by using Percent-Encoding described in RFC3986.

== Description ==

Non-ASCII characters can be used in the URL, but they have to be encoded (RFC3986). URL encoding is widely used (e.g. Wikipedia http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:%E9%80%A3%E7%B5%A1%E5%85%88).<br>
This plugin encodes NON-ASCII characters in the slugs of your pretty permalinks. So your slugs may look like `fußball-in-nürnberg` or `連絡先`.<br>
